                    <p>
                        VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. Enables users to send and receive data
                        across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to
                        the private network. To ensure security,
                        the private network connection is established using an encrypted
                        layered tunneling protocol.

                        <p>
                            Privacy is about respecting individuals. If a person has
                            a reasonable desire to keep something private, it is disrespectful
                            to ignore that person reasons without compelling reasons to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Personal data is used to make very important decisions in our lives.
                            Personal data can be used to affect our reputations; and it can be
                            used to influence our decisions and shape our behaviour. In the wrong,
                            hands, personal data can be used to cause us great harm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Privacy is key to freedom of thought. A watchful eye over everything
                            we read or watch can chill us from exploring ideas outside the mainstream.
                            Privacy is also key to protecting speaking unpopular messages

                        <p>
                            The current Australian Data Retention Laws force ISPs to retain from you
                            a lot of information. Furthermore, as of April 2017, in Australia,
                            internet service providers can sell your browsing history to third parties.

                            Many countries around the world seek to limit outside influences and therefore
                            block internet connections and censor content whenever and wherever possible.
                        </p>

                            China is in the top of the list. China will not enable you to navigate popular
                            website such as Google and Facebook, nor give you access to popular mobile
                            applications such as Google Maps, YouTube or Whatsapp.

                            <b>Hotels change their prices according to your booking location</b>. For example,
                            if you book a hotel in London from America, the prices are (usually)  going to be more
                            expensive then if you book the stay from India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Likewise, a local rate booked for your travel arrangements from 'inside' the country,

                            reserved 'locally', is generally cheaper than rates offered 'outside' the country.

                        <p>Your ISP purposely can regulate the speed of your broadband web connection.
                            This activity is known as <i>throttling</i>. This method is typically an
                            open technique utilised by ISPs to direct systems movement and ease network congestion.</p>

                            VPNs are run by groups of people and as we all know altruism aside, humans don't do
                            things for free. When you use a free VPN - <i>you become the product</i>.
